This argument is called the file mode, and `'r'` means that you only want to read data. If you specify `'w'`, it means that you want to write data into the file, which we will talk about later. One very important point is that when you open a file that already exists for writing, the contents of the file are cleared, and can’t be recovered. If you instead want to append data to an existing file you should specify `'a'` as the mode. If you specify `'r+'` then you can read and write to the file.

If you compare `lines[1]` in Python with the second line in the file, you will see some differences. Most obvious is the presence of a `\\n` at the end of each line in the Python list. These are _newline characters_ and we need to remember to remove these when we process the data from the file. Although it looks like two characters, it is what is called an escape character: just a single character but one with special meaning to the program and which we cannot normally see in a string. On most of the other lines there is another escape `\\t`, which is a _tab character_. Again, we need to remember this for use later.

    "Using `.readlines()` to create a list containing all of the lines is nice and simple, but has a major drawback. It’s fine when your file is small enough to read all of the lines into memory, but if you are reading a 32Gb SAM file, you are likely to run into problems. Here, you want to read one line at a time, and process it. Python files do have a `.readline()` method that will read only one line, but it’s best to just use a `for` loop. Python has an idea of 'iterable' data types which you can put into `for` loops. We have seen two of these so far: the list and the dictionary. For a list you get each element in turn, and for a dictionary you get each key in turn. Strings are also iterable and return each character in turn. The point of mentioning this now is that files are also iterable, and Python tries to pass you exactly what we want: one line at a time. So we can start to write a program now to start processing this data file. "

This is slightly clumsy - given that we have already gone to so much trouble to create our dictionary of dictionaries above - but it is good to have a single structure that holds all of our data, and a separate one that contains only the data for plotting. If you'd like to learn more advanced ways of handling and processing data in Python, I recommend reading about [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) and [object class definitions](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes)."

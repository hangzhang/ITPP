    "The Bio-IT Project aims to achieve its objectives through activity in four areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- training and consultation\n",
    "- regular networking of interested parties, encouraging community building and knowledge transfer between computational biologists\n",
    "- establishing and maintaining community resources\n",
